# Contactless Biometric Recognition Project

Welcome to the Github Repository of ISFCR Summer Internship Project 2024

This project consists of two parts

### Part 1: Contactless Biometric Recognition

1. Project focuses on the development of a contactless biometric recognition system using palm print. 
The system utilizes image processing and machine learning techniques to accurately recognize individuals based on the unique patterns in their palms.

### Part 2: Anomalous CAN Packets Detection

2. Detection of anomalous CAN (Controller Area Network) packets and deployment of the detection system on a central gateway.

In the second part of the project, we focus on detecting anomalous CAN packets to enhance the security of automotive systems. The system is designed to be deployed on a central gateway, where it can monitor and detect any suspicious activities in real-time.
